This is a screenshot of a duck guessing game that we worked on in class! It requests a number guess and it will return a response on your guesses acurracy and display the number of ducks that were there!

I added a yellow background and changed the text to something I though would be a bit more fitting for a game like this, and I created my own duck picture!

This assignment is a little representation of a school morning we were instructed to create in class! I personally LOVE Twine, so this was really fun got me in class!

I simply just created branching pathways based onmy actual thoughts in the morning when I wake up for school!

Though I could've done a *lot* more, but it was early and I didn't feel like it.

Here's the link for you to try it out yourself! [Story](https://twinery.org/2/#/stories/02050826-375c-4099-a6b8-12a98dc2cda3/play)

This was a little code we worked on in Processing where we created composition pictures using images! Mine was based off of Splatoon 3!

To make it a little more interesting, I made mine in a way that makes it feels like your composition is a composition of gacha pulls!

I pulled a bunch of sprites off the internet from a Splatoon archive website and recolored the special and weapon icons, and when the composition was done, I added a final message congradulating you on the things you got!

This one, we made with a student that came in and showed us all how to make this one!

I personally had a little trouble creating this, there was an issue with a code that me and my friends sitting next to me couldn't identify, but after fiddling a bit more with the code, we got it to work!

And there is my beautigul picture of a puppy on the right side!

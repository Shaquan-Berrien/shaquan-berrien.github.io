This is a screenshot of a duck guessing game that we worked on in class! It requests a number guess and it will return a response on your guesses acurracy and display the number of ducks that were there!

I added a yellow background and changed the text to something I though would be a bit more fitting for a game like this, and I created my own duck picture!

This assignment is a little representation of a school morning we were instructed to create in class! I personally LOVE Twine, so this was really fun got me in class!

I simply just created branching pathways based onmy actual thoughts in the morning when I wake up for school!

Though I could've done a *lot* more, but it was early and I didn't feel like it.

Here's the link for you to try it out yourself! [Story](https://twinery.org/2/#/stories/02050826-375c-4099-a6b8-12a98dc2cda3/play)

This was a little code we worked on in Processing where we created composition pictures using images! Mine was based off of Splatoon 3!

To make it a little more interesting, I made mine in a way that makes it feels like your composition is a composition of gacha pulls!

I pulled a bunch of sprites off the internet from a Splatoon archive website and recolored the special and weapon icons, and when the composition was done, I added a final message congradulating you on the things you got!


## AI: Doodle App

This one, we made with a student that came in and showed us all how to make this one!

I personally had a little trouble creating this, there was an issue with a code that me and my friends sitting next to me couldn't identify, but after fiddling a bit more with the code, we got it to work!

And there is my beautiful picture of a puppy on the right side!

# Project

## Project 2: Algorithms in Game Design

Out of all the projects we had to complete in this class, project 1 was by far my favorite. I created this project using Twine!

Project 1 was about the use of algorithms in our career field and considering how it can be an issue from both sides of the consumer and developer!

In opposed to just making it as an informational piece, I made it in the form of a conversation between the project and the reader!

Finding research for this project was the hardest part, but after that, I just typed it all out in one whim! You can click here to go see it for yourself! [Project 1](https://twinery.org/2/#/stories/b425d88c-3861-46f3-8590-721a77fc5125/play)

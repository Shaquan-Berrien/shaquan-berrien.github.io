This is a screenshot of a duck guessing game that we worked on in class! It requests a number guess and it will return a response on your guesses acurracy and display the number of ducks that were there!

I added a yellow background and changed the text to something I though would be a bit more fitting for a game like this, and I created my own duck picture!

This assignment is a little representation of a school morning we were instructed to create in class! I personally LOVE Twine, so this was really fun got me in class!

Though I could've done a *lot* more, it was early and I didn't feel like it.

Here's the link for you to try it! [Story](https://twinery.org/2/#/stories/02050826-375c-4099-a6b8-12a98dc2cda3/play)

This is a screenshot of a duck guessing game that we worked on in class! It requests a number guess and it will return a response on your guesses acurracy and display the number of ducks that were there!
I added a yellow background and changed the text to something I though would be a bit more fitting for a game like this, and I created my own duck picture!
